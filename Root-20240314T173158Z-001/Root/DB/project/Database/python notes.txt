Python 
Today, Python is one of the most popular programming 
Although it is a general-purpose language, it is used in various areas
of applications such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, web 
IoT, and more.

the latest Python 3.11.2 version.


What is Python?
Python is a very popular general-purpose interpreted, 
interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming 
Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected programming language. 
It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source 
code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including Procedural, 
Object Oriented and Functional programming language. Python design 
emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.




Python Jobs

Today, Python is very high in demand and all the major 
companies are looking for great Python Programmers to develop websites, 
software components, and applications
or to work with Data Science, AI, and ML technologies



Today a Python Programmer with 3-5 years of experience is asking for around $150,000 annual package and this is the 
most demanding programming language in America. Though it can vary depending on the location of the Job.
It's impossible to 
list all of the companies using Python, to name a few big companies are:

Google
Intel
NASA
PayPal
Facebook
IBM
Amazon
Netflix
Pinterest
Uber
Many more...
So, you could be the next potential employee for any of these major companies. 


Why to Learn Python?


Python is consistently rated as one of the world's most popular programming languages. 
Python is fairly easy to learn, so if you are starting to learn any programming language
then Python could be your great choice. Today various Schools, Colleges and Universities 
are teaching Python as their primary programming language. There are many other good reasons 
which makes Python as the top choice of any programmer:

Python is Open Source which means its available free of cost.
Python is simple and so easy to learn
Python is versatile and can be used to create many different things.
Python has powerful development libraries include AI, ML etc.
Python is much in demand and ensures high salary
Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer
specially when they are working in Web Development Domain.
  

I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:

Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter.
You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.

Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.

Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code 
within objects.

Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the
 development 
of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.




Careers with Python
If you know Python nicely, then you have a great career ahead. Here are just a few of the career options where Python is a key skill:

Game developer
Web designer
Python developer
Full-stack developer
Machine learning engineer
Data scientist
Data analyst
Data engineer
DevOps engineer
Software engineer
Many more other roles





Applications of Python

The latest release of Python is 3.x. As mentioned before, 
Python is one of the most widely used language over the web. I'm going to list few of them here:

Easy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. 
This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.

Easy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.

Easy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.

A broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows,
and Mac.

Interactive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets 
of code.

Portable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.

Extendable − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or 
customize their tools to be more efficient.

Databases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.
